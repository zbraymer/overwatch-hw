# Rail Finder

## To use this tool:

1. Unzip the folder/repository, change directory to folder.

    `cd <directory/of/script>`

2. create a conda environment
    
    `conda env create -f overwatch.yml`
    `conda activate overwatch`

3. Run the script

    `python rail_finder.py <path/to/image_file>`


### Optional
Use the tool as a command line script (this is different than installing -- 
will create a link from code to site-packages)

`python setup.py develop`

`rail_finder <path/to/image_file>`
